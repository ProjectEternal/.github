# Eternal
Eternal was a scrapped In Game Project for OT6.5 by @GDBOI101
<br>
Project was very early in development and more of a PoC.
## About
I began this project about 2 years ago with few updates every couple months but It was intended to be an Alternative to Project Mercury (lot's of love to them) using a Dll rather than Paks
<br>
This project has little to no Gameplay and mainly a PoC
<br>
If you're looking for a more playable experience I suggest using [Mercury](https://discord.com/invite/2yPVPYTD6K)
